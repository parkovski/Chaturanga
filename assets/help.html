<center><h3><a name="1"></a>Starting the Game</h3></center>
You are presented with a board which somewhat resembles a chess board.
Unlike chess, there are four teams. In this version of Chaturanga,
you may set any or all of the four players to automatic (computer player) mode.
When the traffic lights by the dice are green, you are allowed to move.
When they are red, that player will move on their own.
By default, you play as the black team. Each turn you are allowed a maximum of two moves,
determined by the dice shown below the board. You may use neither, one, or both of these.
If you use both, the game will automatically update to the next player's turn,
otherwise you must press the "Next Turn" button to signify you are done.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3><a name="2"></a>Object of the Game</h3></center>
The object of the game is to be the last team with a raja (hint: he's wearing a crown).
You accomplish this by taking pieces, or by sitting in the corner and
hoping that the other teams will eliminate themselves.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3><a name="3"></a>Moving Pieces</h3></center>
Each piece has a certain way it is allowed to move. This is similar to chess.
<h5>Pawn</h5>
Pawns can move toward the opposite end of the board one space at a time,
and must take diagonally like in chess.
Unlike chess, they may never move two spaces in one move.
<h5>Ship</h5>
These are almost always useless and it usually benefits you more to get it taken
as soon as possible. They can move two spaces diagonally at a time (no more, no less),
and cannot take a raja.
<h5>Horse</h5>
This piece moves exactly like its chess counterpart. It moves in an 'L' shape
(one space in one direction, two spaces in another), and can jump other pieces.
<h5>Elephant</h5>
This piece moves exactly like a rook (castle) in chess. It moves any number of spaces
forward, backward, or to either side, but can't jump other pieces. If you roll double
elephants however, you can usually do some pretty awesome stuff. Except if you start
with that move. Then you can do nothing.
<h5>Raja</h5>
This piece moves exactly like a king in chess, with the difference that there is
no such thing as check, so you may move right next to another raja.
This strategy is called taking the risk.
<br />
<br />
<center><h3><a name="4"></a>The Dice</h3></center>
Chaturanga operates with two dice. Each turn you may move two pieces,
but they must be the pieces shown on the dice. Each roll may only be used once
(including a raja/pawn roll, where either a raja or a pawn may be moved),
but it is possible to roll doubles, in which case you can move a piece twice.
<font color="red"><b>**Important:</b> if you roll a piece you don't have,
you may also move a pawn instead.</font>
This is why it's a good idea to get your ship taken.<br />
Though unnecessary most of the time, you may select which die to use
when moving a piece. This is really only necessary when moving a pawn,
especially when retrieving a lost piece. To change which die will be used,
touch it after selecting the piece you want to move. It will change to green
if you are allowed to use it.
<br />
<center><h3><a name="4andahalf"></a>Undo</h3></center>
Undo is supported in the case of an accidental move. Pressing undo (menu&rarr;undo)
will cause the moves of any computer players which have moved since your turn
to also be undone. If you chose to skip your turn, you cannot use undo to get it back.
Undo is guaranteed to go back for at least one whole turn cycle.
<center><h3><a name="5"></a>Other Awesome Stuff</h3></center>
<ul>
<li>If you get a pawn across the board, you can get back a piece you have previously lost.
You can choose not to, although the pawn becomes useless at this point.
<li>If you manage to move your raja onto the throne space of the team directly across from you,
and that team has already lost its raja, you will take over that team and be able to move
its pieces on your turn. Your raja will not need to stay on that space at this point.
<li>If you don't like how the game is playing, look at the options,
there might be something there that can help you.
</ul>
<br />
That's all for now. Enjoy!<br />

# Chaturanga
Chaturanga for Android

All the game logic is in [BoardView.java](src/com/parkovski/BoardView.java). I already know this whole thing is really confusing and badly written, so please don't separation of concerns me. It does work though, and it's on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.parkovski&hl=en).
